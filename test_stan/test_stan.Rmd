In this Stan program, we let theta be a transformation of mu, eta, and tau instead of declaring theta in the parameters block, which allows the sampler will run more efficiently (see detailed explanation). We can prepare the data (which typically is a named list) in R with:

```{r}
schools_dat <- list(J = 8, 
                    y = c(28,  8, -3,  7, -1,  1, 18, 12),
                    sigma = c(15, 10, 16, 11,  9, 11, 10, 18))

```

And we can get a fit with the following R command. Note that the argument to file = should point to where the file is on your file system unless you have put it in the working directory of R in which case the below will work.


```{r}
fit <- stan(file = 'schools.stan', data = schools_dat)
```
The object fit, returned from function stan is an S4 object of class stanfit. On Windows you may get a warning about g++ not being found but this appears to be harmless. Methods such as print, plot, and pairs are associated with the fitted result so we can use the following code to check out the results in fit. print provides a summary for the parameter of the model as well as the log-posterior with name lp__ (see the following example output). For more methods and details of class stanfit, see the help of class stanfit.

In particular, we can use the extract function on stanfit objects to obtain the samples. extract extracts samples from the stanfit object as a list of arrays for parameters of interest, or just an array. In addition, S3 functions as.array, as.matrix, and as.data.frame are defined for stanfit objects (using help("as.array.stanfit") to check out the help document in R).

```{r}
print(fit)
plot(fit)
pairs(fit, pars = c("mu", "tau", "lp__"))

```

```{r}
la <- extract(fit, permuted = TRUE) # return a list of arrays 
mu <- la$mu
```


```{r}
### return an array of three dimensions: iterations, chains, parameters 
a <- extract(fit, permuted = FALSE) 

### use S3 functions on stanfit objects
a2 <- as.array(fit)
m <- as.matrix(fit)
d <- as.data.frame(fit) # 4000 obs of 19 variables: mu, tau, eta[1] - eta[8], theta[1] - theta[8]

```
