# Statistical Rethinking 2 with `Stan` and `R`

[Vincent](http://arelbundock.com) is trying to replicate (nearly) all the models in Richard McElreath's [*Statistical Rethinking (2nd ed.)*](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) book using `Stan`, `R`, `rstan`, `tidybayes`, and `ggplot2`. *This is work in progress.*

# Caveat

I make no claim to expertise. This project was started as a way to learn Stan and Bayesian statistics. If you find bad code or inacurate content, please send me an email or file an issue on Github.
